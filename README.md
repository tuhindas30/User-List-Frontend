## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS

## Assumptions

- User statuses that doesn't match the required condition shows `Unknown`.
- Since there is not close button on modal, it closes if user clicks outside the modal.
- Username is concatenation of first name and last name in lower case.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install && yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
